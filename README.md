# Dumb Plugin

A dumb plugin that is for demo purposes only... based on the boilerplate here: [https://github.com/whatadewitt/plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/whatadewitt/plugin-boilerplate)

## Description

Seriously, don't use this.

## Installation

Don't install it. If you do, don't activate it.

If you have activated it, deactivate it.

If you're still having issues, please contact me, donate me a few thousand dollars which I'll use to fly to wherever you are and whack you in the head with a tire iron.
